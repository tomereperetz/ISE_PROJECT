# ISE_PROJECT
Image creating interface

Create images using basic 2D geometries (Triangle, Polygon) and 3D geometries (Sphere, Cylinder, etc.).

The project implements Phong's lighting model and allows the user to create objects, 
lighting bodies, and shadows.

For coloring, the RGB model is used.

Some improvements and features were inserted, such as focal point implementation, 
simulating real camera function, and BVH model, improving run time results.
Also, a super sampling model was implemented, improving picture resolution, and disabling pixels' visuality

The final picture produced (and graded) is a backgammon board
 of 30 Cylinders, 24 Triangles, and approximately 20 polygons.
The picture also includes 5 different lighting sources - 
1 ambient light source and 4 spotlight sources were set in different locations and directions.

The development process was Test Driven.

Final grade - 100 (including bonus for excelent work - efficiency and clarity).
